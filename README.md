This repository is a backup for my Application Development class. If you wish, you can check out Project 4 in /CECS277 APP DEV/src/cecs277/project_4/ and play with the game master application. To start the complete game, copy the files into an IDE and run GameMaster.java. You can also run any of the games individually, but it is designed to start at GameMaster.

Enjoy!
